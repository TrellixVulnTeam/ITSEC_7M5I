This is not a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is the real thing Kick back watch it crumble See the drowning, watch the fall I feel just terrible about it That's sarcasm, let it burn I'm gonna make a toast when it falls apart I'm gonna raise my glass above my heart Then someone shouts "That's what they get!" For all the years of hit and run For all the piss broke bands on VH1 Where did all, their money go? Don't we all know Parasitic music industry As it destroys itself We'll show them how it's supposed to be Music written from devotion Not ambition, not for fame Zero people are exploited There are no tricks, up our sleeve Gonna fight against the mass appeal We're gonna kill the seven record deal Make records that have more than one good song The dinosaurs will slowly die And I do believe no one will cry I'm just fucking glad I'm gonna be There to watch the fall Prehistoric music industry Three feet in la brea tar Extinction never felt so good If you think anyone would feel badly You are sadly, mistaken The time has come for evolution Fuck collusion, kill the five Whatever happened to the handshake? Whatever happened to deals no-one would break? What happened to integrity? It's still there it always was For playing music just because A million reasons why (All) dinosaurs will die
